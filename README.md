# JP_PLS
Static fields and values for my Japanese Practice and Learning system to allow for public contribution to accuracy, coverage range, quality and more regarding its content.

The goal is to allow transparency in its content in order to prevent closed source translation inaccuracies and allow people to contribute if they appreciate the system and want to help.

### How to contribute?

If you want to contribute by correcting an inaccuracy, adding to the existing data by expanding it's range or suggesting edits, you can:
- Create an issue describing your suggestion(s)
- Create a fork, make your changes and make a pull request along an issue describing your changes, source and process for it.
- Reach out for any non direct github changes and requests.

**All requests, changes and issues will be manually reviewed by myself and verified with Competent and Native Japanese speakers**
